for the app to run you need to do some commands first

be sure to have node js installed, so that you can run npm

first, install parcel if you don't have it: npm install -g parcel-bundler
and last, run the index.html file through parcel: parcel index.html

parcel will make local development server on http://localhost:1234

that's all :)
